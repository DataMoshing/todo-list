## Notes / improvements
A functional to-do list application that can add projects and add tasks to those projects. Although functioning it is missing localStorage, so I could not implement it.
A feature that would be nice to add later on would be editing the project title along with fixing the date format yyyy/mm/dd to mm/dd/yyyy. UI can also use a bit of work,
more color to make it pop more.
